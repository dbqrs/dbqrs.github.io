### **How Does a Cron Job Work?**
1. **Cron Daemon (crond):**
   - The **cron daemon** is a program that constantly runs in the background and checks every minute to see if there's a scheduled task that needs to be executed.

2. **Crontab (Cron Table):**
   - The **crontab** is a file where you list all the tasks you want to schedule. Think of it as a "to-do list" for your computer.

3. **Format of a Cron Job:**
   - Each line in the crontab represents one task.
   - A line has two parts:
     1. **Schedule** (When the task should run).
     2. **Command** (What the task should do).

### **Basic Format of a Cron Job**
A cron job has 5 fields to define the schedule, followed by the command to run:

```
MINUTE HOUR DAY MONTH WEEKDAY COMMAND
```

- **MINUTE:** (0–59) What minute of the hour?  
- **HOUR:** (0–23) What hour of the day?  
- **DAY:** (1–31) What day of the month?  
- **MONTH:** (1–12) Which month?  
- **WEEKDAY:** (0–6) Which day of the week? (0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc.)  
- **COMMAND:** The program or script to run.

---

### **Examples:**
#### 1. Reboot the system every day at 5:00 AM:
```bash
0 5 * * * /sbin/reboot
```
- **0**: Minute = 0 (on the hour).  
- **5**: Hour = 5 AM.  
- **\***: Any day of the month.  
- **\***: Any month.  
- **\***: Any weekday.

#### 2. Delete temporary files at midnight on the 1st of every month:
```bash
0 0 1 * * rm -rf /tmp/*
```
- **0 0**: At 12:00 AM (midnight).  
- **1**: On the 1st of the month.  
- **\***: Any month.  
- **\***: Any weekday.

#### 3. Run a backup script every Friday at 6 PM:
```bash
0 18 * * 5 /path/to/backup.sh
```
- **0 18**: At 6:00 PM.  
- **\***: Any day.  
- **5**: Friday.
