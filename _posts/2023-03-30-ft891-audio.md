Have a friend listen to your audio and ask them if you sound distorted or if your audio is too weak.  I have my mic gain set at 30 with the processor set at 20.  I have a strong voice projection so 30 is enough.  For others 35 or 40 might be needed for mic gain.  I can’t imagine needing to set the mic gain higher than 50 though.

The ALC meter should go to approximately half scale as you speak.  There is a mark halfway and the bar thickness changes to a thin line.  When you speak into your mic, the meter should deflect to the halfway mark, but not too much beyond halfway.  Note that you cannot completely rely on the ALC meter.  The meters are never dead on.  Neither are compression meters.  The meters might get you close, but it is best to verify on air with a friend who knows your voice.
