**redirect the output (AKA stdout) to a file:**    
SomeCommand > SomeFile.txt  

**Or if you want to append data:**  
SomeCommand >> SomeFile.txt

**If you want stderr as well use this:**  
SomeCommand &> SomeFile.txt  

**or this to append:**  
SomeCommand &>> SomeFile.txt  

**if you want to have both stderr and output displayed on the console and in a file use this:**  
SomeCommand 2>&1 | tee SomeFile.txt  
sudo apt upgrade >&1 | tee upgrade_log.log  
^^  
(If you want the output only, drop the 2 above)
