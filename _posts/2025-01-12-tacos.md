3. **Cook the Beef**:  
   - Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat.  
   - Cook the marinated beef in batches to avoid overcrowding, about 2-3 minutes per side, until browned and cooked through. Remove and keep warm.

4. **Assemble the Tacos**:  
   - Warm the tortillas in a skillet or microwave.  
   - Fill each tortilla with a portion of the cooked beef, a spoonful of slaw, and optional toppings like kimchi, jalapeÃ±os, or cilantro.  
   - Serve with lime wedges on the side for a tangy finish.

#### **Tips**:
- Swap beef for chicken, pork, or tofu for variety.  
- Gochujang and gochugaru can be found in most Asian grocery stores or online.
