Was at a hamfest and picked up an old, Kenwood TM-231a for $35. It's in great condition and works really good for it's age, 30+ years. I got it for the purpose of experimentation, so if I break it, no big deal.


1. Press the **VFO** button to leave memory mode
2. Turn the VFO to the receive frequency of the repeater
3. If needed, press **Shift** to set the fequency shift -/+ (blank for simplex)
4. To set the PLL tone, press **Tone** until a T appears in the upper right side of the display. Long press **F**, until F flashes, and then press **Tone** again. Select desired PLL tone frequency by turning the VFO and press **Tone** to set
5. To save the repeater into memory, press **F** and turn the VFO to the desired memory location, 1 through 20, then press **MR**
