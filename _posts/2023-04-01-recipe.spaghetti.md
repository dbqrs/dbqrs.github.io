## Mom's Spaghetti
**Ingrediants**  
2 lbs. ground beef  
1 lb. ground pork  
1 glove garlic chopped  
1 large yellow onion diced  
1 jar sliced green olives (drained) with pimento or about 2 cups  
1 tablespoon Dried oregano or Italian seasoning  
3 bay leaves  
Â¾ cup sugar < - Optional  
48-ounce can tomato juice  
36- to 48-ounce of tomato paste  

Cook meat with the diced onion. Season with salt and pepper. Add a couple tablespoons of flour to soak up all the grease and cook a minute to cook out flour taste.  

Deglaze the pan with tomato juice, carefully scraping up flour bits off of bottom of pan. Add the rest of the ingredients. Bring to a hard simmer then take heat down to a low simmer and let cook. The longer the better. It should be nice and thick with a savory onion and briny olive taste with a sweet tomato finish.  

Serve on spaghetti noodles topped with parmesan, and with some cheesy garlic bread.
