    "content": "Here are eight ways to season tacos.1. Classic Taco SeasoningThis is a traditional seasoning mix that gives tacos a balanced, savory flavor.Ingredients:  1 tablespoon chili powder  1 teaspoon cumin  1 teaspoon paprika  1 teaspoon garlic powder  1 teaspoon onion powder  ½ teaspoon oregano  ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional for heat)  ½ teaspoon salt  ¼ teaspoon black pepperInstructions:  Mix all the ingredients together in a small bowl.  Add to ground beef, chicken, or vegetables while cooking.  Simmer with ¼ cup of water for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld.2. Smoky Chipotle Taco SeasoningFor those who like a smoky kick, this blend uses chipotle for a deep, rich flavor.Ingredients:  1 tablespoon chipotle chili powder  1 teaspoon smoked paprika  1 teaspoon cumin  ½ teaspoon garlic powder  ½ teaspoon onion powder  ½ teaspoon ground coriander  ½ teaspoon salt  ¼ teaspoon black pepperInstructions:  Combine all the spices in a small dish.  Use to season beef, pork, or mushrooms for a smoky taco filling.  Add ¼ cup of water and simmer the mixture with the protein for a few minutes.3. Zesty Lime Taco SeasoningA bright, citrusy seasoning perfect for fish or chicken tacos.Ingredients:  1 tablespoon chili powder  1 teaspoon cumin  1 teaspoon paprika  ½ teaspoon garlic powder  ½ teaspoon onion powder  1 teaspoon lime zest (from 1 lime)  ½ teaspoon salt  ¼ teaspoon black pepperInstructions:  Mix all the dry spices and the lime zest in a bowl.  Add to your protein or vegetables while cooking.  Finish with fresh lime juice after cooking for an extra burst of flavor.4. Spicy Sriracha Taco SeasoningFor a fiery, tangy taco, this mix incorporates sriracha for heat.Ingredients:  1 tablespoon sriracha powder (or 2 teaspoons sriracha sauce)  1 teaspoon chili powder  1 teaspoon cumin  ½ teaspoon garlic powder  ½ teaspoon onion powder  ½ teaspoon paprika  ½ teaspoon salt  ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepperInstructions:  Combine the dry ingredients (if using sriracha powder) or add the sriracha sauce with the spices.  Stir into the meat or vegetables as they cook.  Add a little water to help the seasoning blend into the dish.5. Sweet and Spicy Pineapple Taco SeasoningA tropical twist on taco seasoning with a hint of sweetness from pineapple.Ingredients:  1 tablespoon chili powder  1 teaspoon cumin  ½ teaspoon garlic powder  ½ teaspoon onion powder  ½ teaspoon smoked paprika  ½ teaspoon salt  ¼ teaspoon black pepper  ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon  2 tablespoons crushed pineapple (drained)Instructions:  Mix all the spices together, then stir in the crushed pineapple.  Cook with your choice of protein, especially pork or chicken.  Add water if needed to evenly distribute the flavors while cooking.6. Cocoa &amp; Ancho Taco SeasoningThis unique seasoning incorporates unsweetened cocoa powder, often used in Mexican mole sauces, for a deep, earthy flavor that complements traditional taco ingredients.Ingredients:  1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder  1 tablespoon ancho chili powder  1 teaspoon cumin  ½ teaspoon smoked paprika  ½ teaspoon garlic powder  ½ teaspoon onion powder  ½ teaspoon ground coriander  ½ teaspoon cinnamon  ½ teaspoon salt  ¼ teaspoon black pepperInstructions:  Mix: Combine all ingredients in a small bowl.  Cook: Brown your protein (beef, chicken, pork, or even tofu), then sprinkle the seasoning over it. Stir to coat evenly.  Simmer: Add ¼ cup of water or broth to the pan and simmer for 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.  Serve: Use the seasoned filling in tacos with toppings like shredded lettuce, queso fresco, and a drizzle of crema or guacamole.Why It Works:The cocoa powder adds depth and richness without making the tacos taste sweet. Combined with the smokiness of ancho chili powder and a hint of cinnamon, it brings an exciting twist that still feels grounded in traditional Mexican flavors.7. Korean Beef TacosThese Korean-inspired tacos combine sweet, savory, and spicy flavors, topped with a crunchy slaw for the perfect fusion dish.IngredientsFor the Beef:  1 lb (450g) thinly sliced beef (ribeye, sirloin, or brisket)  ¼ cup soy sauce  2 tablespoons brown sugar  1 tablespoon sesame oil  1 tablespoon rice vinegar  2 cloves garlic, minced  1 teaspoon ginger, grated  1 teaspoon gochujang (Korean chili paste) or sriracha  1 teaspoon sesame seeds (optional)  2 tablespoons vegetable oil (for cooking)For the Slaw:  2 cups shredded cabbage (red or green)  1 carrot, julienned  2 green onions, thinly sliced  2 tablespoons rice vinegar  1 tablespoon soy sauce  1 teaspoon sesame oil  ½ teaspoon sugar  ½ teaspoon gochugaru (Korean chili flakes) or chili powder  1 teaspoon sesame seeds (optional)For Assembly:  8 small flour or corn tortillas  Kimchi (optional, for topping)  Sliced jalapeños (optional, for heat)  Fresh cilantro or mint leaves  Lime wedgesInstructions  Marinate the Beef:          In a bowl, whisk together soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, rice vinegar, minced garlic, ginger, and gochujang.      Add the beef slices to the marinade, ensuring they’re evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours.        Prepare the Slaw:          In a large bowl, toss the shredded cabbage, carrot, and green onions.      In a small bowl, mix rice vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, and gochugaru. Pour over the slaw and toss to combine. Sprinkle with sesame seeds if using. Chill until ready to serve.        Cook the Beef:          Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat.      Cook the marinated beef in batches to avoid overcrowding, about 2-3 minutes per side, until browned and cooked through. Remove and keep warm.        Assemble the Tacos:          Warm the tortillas in a skillet or microwave.      Fill each tortilla with a portion of the cooked beef, a spoonful of slaw, and optional toppings like kimchi, jalapeños, or cilantro.      Serve with lime wedges on the side for a tangy finish.      Tips:  Swap beef for chicken, pork, or tofu for variety.  Gochujang and gochugaru can be found in most Asian grocery stores or online.  If you like extra heat, drizzle with a spicy mayo (mix mayo and sriracha).Enjoy these vibrant and flavorful Korean tacos for a fun twist on taco night! 🌮8. Sweet and Spicy Mango Habanero SeasoningIngredients:  1 tbsp chili powder  1 tsp ground cumin  1 tsp paprika  1/2 tsp garlic powder  1/2 tsp onion powder  1/2 tsp salt  1 ripe mango, diced  1-2 habanero peppers, finely chopped (adjust for heat)Instructions:  Mix the dry spices together.  Cook your meat until browned, add the seasoning mix, diced mango, and habanero. Stir well and let it simmer until the mango softens and flavors meld."

    "content": "How Does a Cron Job Work?  Cron Daemon (crond):          The cron daemon is a program that constantly runs in the background and checks every minute to see if there’s a scheduled task that needs to be executed.        Crontab (Cron Table):          The crontab is a file where you list all the tasks you want to schedule. Think of it as a “to-do list” for your computer.        Format of a Cron Job:          Each line in the crontab represents one task.      A line has two parts:                  Schedule (When the task should run).          Command (What the task should do).                    Basic Format of a Cron JobA cron job has 5 fields to define the schedule, followed by the command to run:MINUTE HOUR DAY MONTH WEEKDAY COMMAND  MINUTE: (0–59) What minute of the hour?  HOUR: (0–23) What hour of the day?  DAY: (1–31) What day of the month?  MONTH: (1–12) Which month?  WEEKDAY: (0–6) Which day of the week? (0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc.)  COMMAND: The program or script to run.Examples:1. Reboot the system every day at 5:00 AM:0 5 * * * /sbin/reboot  0: Minute = 0 (on the hour).  5: Hour = 5 AM.  *: Any day of the month.  *: Any month.  *: Any weekday.2.

Press Enter to quit dumbass\"    ;;esac            Make the script executable:    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/hash-check.sh        You can also verify the permissions with:     ls -l /usr/local/bin/hash-check.sh        You should see something like this for the file:     -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root ... /usr/local/bin/hash-check.sh        The x means it’s executable.  2. Create Nemo Action for MintNemo supports custom actions through the .nemo_action file. You can define the right-click menu item for your hash-check script like this:      Create a custom action file in the Nemo actions folder:    mkdir -p ~/.local/share/nemo/actionsnano ~/.local/share/nemo/actions/hash-check.nemo_action            Add the following content to the file:    [Nemo Action]Name=Check File HashComment=Calculate file hash (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, etc.)Exec=/usr/local/bin/hash-check.sh %FIcon=utilities-terminalSelection=AnyExtensions=any;Terminal=true              Exec=/usr/local/bin/hash-check.sh %F: This will pass the selected file(s) to the hash-check script.      Terminal=true: Ensures that it opens in a terminal window so you can see the output.            Save and close the file.  3. Testing File Hash Script      Restart Nemo to apply the new action:    nemo --quit            Right-click a file in Nemo, and you should see a new menu option called “Check File Hash”. Selecting it will run the hash-check script, allowing you to choose the algorithm and see the results in the terminal.    ChatGPT can be credited for this script. I only made a few minor changes."

Mention estimated time for each step and who is responsible.Example:  Disable Port Monitoring (Alice Smith, 5 mins)          Run: no monitor session 1        Verify Current Switch Firmware Version (Bob Johnson, 3 mins)          Run: show version        Upload New Firmware (Alice Smith, 10 mins)          Upload: copy tftp://192.168.1.1/new-firmware.bin flash:        Install Firmware (Alice Smith, 20 mins)          Run: install add file flash:new-firmware.bin activate commit        Reboot Switch (John Doe, 10 mins)          Run: reload        Post-Reboot Checks (Bob Johnson, 15 mins)          Verify services (ping test, VLAN connectivity, etc.)      5. Rollback Plan  Clear instructions on how to revert the changes if the procedure fails.  Define criteria for when to initiate the rollback.Example:  Rollback Trigger: If services are down for more than 30 minutes post-upgrade.      Reboot switch into old firmware using backup image: boot flash:old-firmware.bin    Restore configuration from the NAS backup: /backups/core_switch/2024-09-07/config.txt    Notify team lead if rollback is initiated.  6. Post-Change Validation and Monitoring  Specify checks that need to be performed after the change to confirm successful implementation.  Assign monitoring responsibilities for any post-change issues.Example:      Check switch logs for errors: show log    Verify VLAN routing is operational: Test with ping between VLAN 10, 20, and 30.    Monitor network traffic for 24 hours to detect any anomalies.  7. Communication and Reporting  Specify who needs to be informed when the change is complete and whether any issues were encountered.  Provide a final report on the success or failure of the change.Example:      Notify stakeholders that the change was successful via email.    Report any anomalies to the IT manager within 1 hour post-implementation.  8. Contingency Planning  List any backup or emergency procedures if the change fails and the rollback is not possible.Example:      In case of network failure, escalate to Network Operations for further troubleshooting.    Use backup switches and reroute traffic through Switch B if Switch A does not come back online.  By using this structure, IT teams can ensure consistency, minimize risk, and handle unexpected issues efficiently during network or server changes."

However, the VMs were able to communicate with each other and other devices connected to the physical network without any problems.This issue appears to be relatively common, yet there is a lack of definitive solutions available. In order to resolve the problem, I removed and re-added the virtual switch, and I also removed and re-added the network cards associated with each VM.UpdateI found another issue where the network adapters are misconfigured. After installing Hyper-V on Server 2022 for example, when creating a virtual switch, it will create a virtual network adapter. If you want the host server and the virtual machines to communicate with each other when the virtual adapter is set up for the virtual switch, you no longer configure IP addresses on the hardware network adapter. Instead, the IP addressing is done on the virtual switch’s virtual adapter."

Cut the chicken breasts in slices, then cut each slices lengthwise into long stripes and then cut crosswise into dice.    Add chicken, five-spice and salt in a bowl. Using a spoon or your hands, combine to coat chicken with spices.Prepare veggies:    Cut bell peppers into strips, then cut these strips in half. Make carrot ribbons using a vegetable peeler and cut broccolini into smaller florets.Prepare sauce:     In a medium bowl, whisk together sauce ingredients.Make stir-fry:    Once everything is ready, heat 2 teaspoons olive oil in a large non-stick skillet over high heat. When oil is hot, add chicken and cook for 3-4 minutes. It’s ok if chicken is still slightly pink because it will finish cooking later. Remove from skillet.     Add another 2 teaspoons of olive oil. Add veggies and stir fry for about 5 minutes. They should still be crispy, so pay attention not to overcook them.    Put chicken back into the skillet and add sauce. Cook for 1 minute, stirring, until sauce thickens and chicken is cooked through.    Serve immediately with jasmine rice and sprinkle with sesame seeds.Recipe Notes:    Five-spice powder can be found in most grocery stores. It’s a mix of star anise, cloves, cinnamon, black pepper and fennel seeds.    If you want to eat this with rice, start heating the cooking water just before prepping the ingredients so that rice and chicken are ready at the same time.    To keep things low-carb/paleo serve your 5-Spice Chicken over cauliflower rice or zoodles.    To make this Whole30-approved, skip the rice vinegar and the honey and add some date paste (blended soaked dates) to the sauce for sweetness. Use coconut aminos instead of soy sauce.Variations:     You can make this recipe with de-boned chicken thighs instead of chicken breast.    Choose whichever veggies YOU want in your chicken stir-fry.  Feel free to toss in some edamame, asparagus, snow peas, baby corn or a bit of shredded cabbage.  Just make sure they’re all sliced or chopped equally in size before you begin cooking.    If you want to add some heat to your chicken stir-fry, add some crushed red pepper flakes."

You do not set the radio to VOX, just the software. If you don’t do this, the mic becomes active during transmit and other weird things happen. See this link for the full troubleshooting session. With the above settings, you will be using USB-Data mode. That’s nice, because you don’t have to keep switching between USB and LSB whenever you change modes/bands."

I have a strong voice projection so 30 is enough.  For others 35 or 40 might be needed for mic gain.  I can’t imagine needing to set the mic gain higher than 50 though.The ALC meter should go to approximately half scale as you speak.  There is a mark halfway and the bar thickness changes to a thin line.  When you speak into your mic, the meter should deflect to the halfway mark, but not too much beyond halfway.  Note that you cannot completely rely on the ALC meter.  The meters are never dead on.  Neither are compression meters.  The meters might get you close, but it is best to verify on air with a friend who knows your voice.FT-891 TX audio settings for hand micMenu #  Setting11-09  100-300015-01  20015-02  1015-03  815-04  130015-05  515-06  815-07  240015-08  715-09  815-10  30015-11  1015-12  815-13  130015-14  515-15  815-16  230015-17  715-18  816-07  3016-08  3016-09  50Function Menu -1…Enable PRC for processor and set to 20Function Menu-2…Enable MEQ"
